== NAME

git-age - Protect secrets required for development in your repository

== DESCRIPTION

`git-age` is a smudge/clean filter for git that encrypts and decrypts files in your repository.
It is designed to be used in a team environment where you want to protect secrets required for development, such as API
keys, passwords, etc.

It is based on the great tool age(1) by Filippo Valsorda.
Every file encrypted by `git-age` is a valid age(1) file, and can be decrypted using the age(1) tool.

== SUBCOMMANDS

=== git age install

Install the git-age hooks in global git configuration.

=== git age init

`git age init` [`--comment` <COMMENT>, `--keys` <KEYS_TXT>]

Initialize the current repository for git-age.
This will:

. create a `.agerecipients` file in the root of the repository
. bootstrap a new keypair for the current user
. add the public key to the `.agerecipients` file, optionally with a comment
. add the private key to the keys file, optionally with a comment

=== git age gen-key

`git age gen-key` [`--comment` <COMMENT> `--keys` <KEYS_TXT>]

To quickly prepare your environment to participate at a project that already uses _git-age_, you can use the `gen-key`
command to:

. generate a new keypair for the current user
. add the private key to the keys file, optionally with a comment
. print the public key for sharing with a developer that already has access

The keys file can either be specified as flag or be read from the environment variable `GIT_AGE_KEYS`.

=== git age add-recipient

`git age add-recipient` [`--comment` <COMMENT> `--keys` <KEYS_TXT> `--message` <COMMIT_MESSAGE>]
<PUBLIC_KEY> +

=== git age files

`files` is the main command to manage the files that should be encrypted and decrypted by `git-age`.

=== git age files list

`git age files list`

Lists all files that are/will be tracked by `git-age`.
This allows to verify that the files that should be encrypted are actually tracked.

=== git age files track

`git age files track` <PATTERN>

Add a file pattern to the `.gitattributes` file to track the file with `git-age`.
`git-age` will either append the pattern to the already present `.gitattributes` file in the *current* directory or
create a new `.gitattributes` file if it does not exist.

=== git age files re-encrypt

`git age files re-encrypt`

Re-encrypt all files that are tracked by `git-age`.
This is useful if you want to change the recipients of the files e.g. if a developer leaves the team.
It can also be used to onboard a new developer to the team but it's recommended to use `git age add-recipient` for that
as it is specifically designed for this use case.

=== git age version

`git age version`

Prints the version of the `git-age` tool.

=== git age version check-update

`git age version check-update`

Checks if there is a new version of the `git-age` tool available.

== EXAMPLES

=== Initialize a new repository

git age init --comment "Alice"

=== Add a new recipient

Bob: +
git age gen-key --comment "Bob" > bob.pub

Alice: +
git age add-recipient --comment "Bob" $(cat bob.pub)
